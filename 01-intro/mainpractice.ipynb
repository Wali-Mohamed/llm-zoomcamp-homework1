Kibo is the highest summit and home to the famous Uhuru Peak.\\n\\nWhile the mountain itself is in Tanzania, it can be seen from Kenya, particularly from Amboseli National Park, which is a popular vantage point due to its excellent views of Kilimanjaro.\\n\\nKilimanjaro is a major destination for adventurous travelers and mountaineers from around the world. Climbing routes vary in difficulty and include the Marangu, Machame, Lemosho, Rongai, and Umbwe routes, each offering unique landscapes and experiences.\\n\\nThe mountain is also known for its diverse ecosystems, ranging from tropical rainforest at its base to alpine desert and arctic conditions at its summit. These varying climates support a wide range of flora and fauna, making Kilimanjaro a hotspot for biodiversity.\\n\\nThe combination of its accessibility, diverse environments, and status as Africa’s tallest mountain makes Kilimanjaro a prominent attraction for both trekkers and nature enthusiasts.'"
